# giudice
Avoid the traffic jam that is judging through automation!

To run Giudice:
```
$ node readtable.js
```

Note for future contributors/users, here is how we expect judging to work:
* Judges go to their assigned tables and give each project TWO scores:
  1. How well the project performs in its given track
  2. How well the project performs overall (this is used to calculate overall winners)

In the case of a project with no given track, it will be judged solely overall.
