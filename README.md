# giudice
Avoid the traffic jam that is judging through automation!

# Ideas
- equation for judging
  - T (total time) S (submissions) V (views) D (demo time) J (judges)
  - D = p (actual pitch time) + t (transition time)
  - SDV/T = J
- Map of venue, perhaps show line from one table to the next
- show timer of how much time is left for current demo (D should include walking time, so D = 10 could be 7 mins judging and 3 walking to new place)
- Show rubric for judging and let judges enter their info and save it
- Consolidate scores for projects and do scores
- When judge is at project, it should show all the prizes that team is going for so they can be judged accordingly
  - Multiple rubrics for multple prizes
